# Cart-Craze

Cart-Craze is a portfolio project that shows my skills in building a responsive e-commerce website. It uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. The project includes features like product filtering, cart and wishlist management, and price calculations.

-   **Axios** for API requests.
-   **NextAuth** for secure authentication.
-   **Resend** for sending transactional emails.

2. Add items to a wishlist or shopping cart.
3. Fully responsive design that works on any device.
4. Smooth navigation between pages (single-page app).
5. Secure authentication with NextAuth.
6. Email notifications with Resend.
